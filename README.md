# Covid-19-Power-BI-Dashboard


## Introduction :

This is about 2020-21 pandemic. COVID-19 is a contagious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In India this pandemic started from January 2020 with a few rate but afterward spread in all over the country and became one of the memorable pandemic in the history of the world. In this project the covered things are the number of death in the Covid-19 in India, number of positive and negative in the total test. These all are showed in the dashboard or per month report of 2020-21. It also shares the information of the number of people hospitalized, admit in ICU or in Ventilator per month and was compared with the total death rate.Covid 19 Data is the best example for practising the Data Visualisation techniques and also provide us some meaningful information about the struggle of the individuals to fight from the contagious disease during 2020-21.

## Project KPI :

In this project, the generated Measures show Average Number of Positive Tests i.e. 8.12M, Average Number of Negative Tests i.e. 30.30M, Average Number of Hospitalized is 57.99K, Average Number of people on Ventilation is 3.98K and Average Number of people in ICU is 12.06K out of 45 billions total tests from 2020-21. These data are shown in the form of KPI in the Dashboard.

## Important Questions derived from the Project :

1. Which year there is maximum death and the highest pending cases ?
2. Which month has the highest pending cases than others ?
3. Which quarter there is highest pending cases ?
4. In which month there is high death rate and which month has low death rate ?
5. Which quarter has highest number of deaths ?
6. What is the total Number of Deaths ?
7. In which month there is highest Negative Cases and which month has lowest ?
8. In which month there is highest Positive Cases and which month has lowest ?

## Based on the report Insights, here are the outcomes :

1. In this Project, there is Year filter to know which year has maximum death rate and how many cases are pending and etc. as I got that 2021 has high death rate and highest pending cases than 2020.

2. From the Project, I found that in March pendings were more as at that time medical requirements for a huge number of patient is less whereas it was decreased in June that was presented in the Table.

</a></p>

3. From this Project, I found that in 1st Quarter the number of pending patients is higher as may be it was the starting phase of Corona time and it dcreased till 3rd Quarter but in the 4th Quarter it was again rose due to lack of proper medical treatment that was displayed in the Table.

</a></p>

4. In my Project, I got that from Feburary 2020 there was continuous increase in death rate till Feburary 2021 and afterward there was a drastic decline in death rate which was displayed in the Line Chart.

5. In this Project, I got that from the 1st Quarter of 2020 to the 1st Quarter of 2021 there was continuous increase in the death rate of the people due to Corona Virus which was displayed in the Line Chart.

6. It was shown that there was total 73M death out of 147M that was presented in the Gauge Chart.

7. In this Project, I got that from March 2020 to Feburary 2021 the Negative Report has increased rapidly and afterward in March 2021 it has decreased which was presented in Matrix Table.

8. In this Project, I found that from January 2020 to Feburary 2021 there was rapid growth in Positive Report which was greater than Negative Report and after that it was decreased in March 2021 but still its rate was greater than Negative Report that was shown in Matrix Table.

## Conclusion :

Covid Pandemic was a really tough period for the whole world. The whole world has suffered from the high death rate in 2020-21. This project is just for the knowledge to imagine the situation we all have gone through. This Project gives a brief knowledge about the number of deaths and number of people struggled in the Queues for their medical treatment. This also shows how we were lacking from the avaliability of medicines and proper medical treatment and facilities due to which the pending cases goes on increasing but lastly we got the success in controlling this pandemic situations and dealing with the Corona Virus.
